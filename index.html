      <p>My name is Jamie and I work in the medical field, specifically physical therapy. I am interested in learning web development as a skill.</p>

      <p>I plan to begin freelancing in full stack web development and using this to supplement my income by working from home.</p>

      <p>After gaining some experience with freelance jobs, I would like to transition to working full-time within the web development and programming space. I especially am interested in web development in the healthcare and financial industries.</p>
